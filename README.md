# ep_remove_collab_fields

ep_remove_collab_fields is a simple plugin for [Etherpad](http://etherpad.org/). It removes the text fields under the users section on Etherpad to prevent users from changing their author name or any of the collaborators names.

This plugin was mostly taken and modified from the [ep_disable_change_author_name plugin](https://github.com/JohnMcLear/ep_disable_change_author_name) by John McLear.
